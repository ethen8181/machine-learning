In practice, the independence assumption is often violated, but **Naive Bayes** still tend to perform very well in the fields of text/document classification. Common applications includes spam filtering (categorized a text message as spam or not-spam) and sentiment analysis (categorized a text message as positive or negative review). More importantly, the simplicity of the method means that it takes order of magnitude less time to train when compared to more complexed models like support vector machines.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before discussing the multinomial document model, it is important to be familiar with the multinomial\n",

For example, suppose that two chess players had played numerous games and it was determined that the probability that Player A would win is 0.40, the probability that Player B would win is 0.35, and the probability that the game would end in a draw is 0.25. The multinomial distribution can be used to answer questions such as: \"If these two chess players played 12 games, what is the probability that Player A would win 7 games, Player B would win 2 games, and the remaining 3 games would be drawn?\" The following generalized formula gives the probability of obtaining a specific set of outcomes when there are $n$ possible outcomes for each event:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P = \\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_d!}p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}...p_d^{n_d}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- n is the total number of events.\n",
    "- $n_1, ..., n_d$ is the number of times outcome 1 to d occurs.\n",
    "- $p_1, ..., p_d$ is the probability of outcome 1 to d will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or more compactly written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{t=1}^{d}n_t!}\\prod_{t=1}^{d}p_t^{x_t}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$p(D_i|C = k) = \\frac{x_i!}{\\prod_{t=1}^{d}x_{it}!}\\prod_{t=1}^{d}p(w_t|C)^{x_{it}} \\propto \\prod_{t=1}^{d}p(w_t|C)^{x_{it}}$$\n",

    "- Often times, we won’t need the normalisation term $\\frac{x_i!}{\\prod_{t=1}^{d}x_{it}!}$, because it does not depend on the class, $C$.\n",
    "- $p(w_t \\mid C)$ is the probability of word $w_t$ occurring in a document of class $C$. This time estimated using the word frequency information from the document's feature vectors. More specifically, this is simply: $\\text{Number of word } w_t \\text{ in class } C \\big/ \\text{Total number of words in class } C$.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Laplace Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "A drawback of the equation for the multinomial model is that the likelihood $p(D_i|C = k)$ involves taking a product of probabilities $p(w_t \\mid C)$: if any one of the terms of the product is zero, then the whole product becomes zero. This means that the probability of the document belonging to the class in question is zero (impossible). Intuitively, just because a word does not occur in a document class in the training data does not mean that it cannot occur in any document of that class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, one way to alleviate the problem is **Laplace Smoothing** or **add one smoothing**, where we add a count of one to each word type and the denominator will be increased by $|V|$, the number of vocabularies (features), to ensure that the probabilities are still normalised. More formally, our $p(w_t \\mid C)$ becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(w_t \\mid C) = \\frac{( \\text{Number of word } w_t \\text{ in class } C + 1 )}{( \\text{Total number of words in class } C) + |V|} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, by performing **Laplace Smoothing**, we ensure that our $p(w_t \\mid C)$ will never equal to 0. If all is lost, try this [Youtube: Multinomial Naive Bayes, a worked example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km2LoOpdB3A)."

To prevent this, we can simply throw a logarithm around everything:\n",

    "- Extremely fast to train/apply and is reliably a high bias/low variance classifier (less likely to overfit).\n",
    "- Handles extraneous featues well, meaning it's robust to irrelevant features.\n",
    "- Famously good at text classification. e.g. spam filtering. Or domains where you have many equally important features, which tends to be a problem for other kind of classifiers, in particular tree based algorithms.\n",
    "- No parameter tuning is required\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conditional independence is not always a valid assumption, thus can be outperformed by other methods.\n",
    "- Predicted probabilities are not well-calibrated."
