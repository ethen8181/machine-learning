    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise uses a small subset of the data from Kaggle's [Yelp Business Rating Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013) competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of the data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`yelp.csv`** contains the dataset. It is stored in the repository (in the **`data`** directory), so there is no need to download anything from the Kaggle website.\n",
    "- Each observation (row) in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.\n",
    "- The **stars** column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review.\n",
    "- The **text** column is the text of the review.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Predict the star rating of a review using **only** the review text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** After each task, I recommend that you check the shape and the contents of your objects, to confirm that they match your expectations."

       "'This is by far my favourite department store, hands down. I have had nothing but perfect experiences in this store, without exception, no matter what department I\\'m in. The shoe SA\\'s will bend over backwards to help you find a specific shoe, and the staff will even go so far as to send out hand-written thank you cards to your home address after you make a purchase - big or small. Tim & Anthony in the shoe salon are fabulous beyond words! \\r\\n\\r\\nI am not completely sure that I understand why people complain about the amount of merchandise on the floor or the lack of crowds in this store. Frankly, I would rather not be bombarded with merchandise and other people. One of the things I love the most about Barney\\'s is not only the prompt attention of SA\\'s, but the fact that they aren\\'t rushing around trying to help 35 people at once. The SA\\'s at Barney\\'s are incredibly friendly and will stop to have an actual conversation, regardless or whether you are purchasing something or not. I have also never experienced a \"high pressure\" sale situation here.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, Barneys is pricey, and there is no getting around it. But, um, so is Neiman\\'s and that place is a crock. Anywhere that ONLY accepts American Express or their charge card and then treats you like scum if you aren\\'t carrying neither is no place that I want to spend my hard earned dollars. Yay Barneys!'"
