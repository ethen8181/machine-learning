    "## Bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary weakness of decision trees is that they don't tend to have the best predictive accuracy and the result can be very unstable. This is partially due to the fact that we were using greedy algorithm to choose the rule/feature to split the tree. Hence a small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. Fortunately, this problem can be mitigated by training an ensemble of decision trees and use these trees to form a \"forest\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This first idea we'll introduce is **Bagging**. **Bagging**, short for **bootstrap aggregation** is a general procedure for reducing the variance of a machine learning algorithm, although it can used with any type of method, it is most commonly applied to tree-based models. The way it works is: \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a training set $X = x_1, ..., x_n$ with responses $Y = y_1, ..., y_n$, bagging repeatedly ($B$ times) selects a random sample with replacement (a.k.a bootstrap sample) of the training set and fits trees to these newly generated samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "For $b = 1, ..., B$:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Sample, with replacement, $n$ training examples from $X$, $Y$; call these $X_b$, $Y_b$. Note that the bootstrap sample should be the same size as the original training set\n",
    "2. Train a tree, $f_b$, on $X_b$, $Y_b$. For these individual tree, we should allow them to grow deeper (increase the max_depth paramter) so that they have low bias/high variance\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, predictions for unseen samples $x'$ can be made by averaging the predictions from all the individual regression trees on $x'$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {\\hat {f}}={\\frac {1}{B}}\\sum _{b=1}^{B}{f}_{b}(x')$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or by taking the majority vote in the case of classification trees. If you are wondering why bootstrapping is a good idea, the rationale is:\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to ask a question of a population but we can't. Instead, we take a sample and ask the question to it instead. Now, how confident we should be that the sample answer is close to the population answer obviously depends on the structure of population. One way we might learn about this is to take samples from the population again and again, ask them the question, and see how variable the sample answers tended to be. But often times this isn't possible (we wouldn't relaunch the Titanic and crash it into another iceberg), thus we can use the information in the sample we actually have to learn about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a reasonable thing to do because not only is the sample you have the best, indeed the only information you have about what the population actually looks like, but also because most samples will, if they're randomly chosen, look quite like the population they came from. In the end, sampling 'with replacement' is just a convenient way to treat the sample like it's a population and to sample from it in a way that reflects its shape."

    "## Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests is very similar to bagged trees. Exactly like bagging, we create an ensemble of decision trees using bootstrapped samples of the training set. When building each tree, however, each time a split is considered, a random sample of $m$ features is chosen as split candidates from the full set of $p$ features. The split is only allowed to use one of those $m$ features to generate the best rule/feature to split on. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For **classification**, $m$ is typically chosen to be, $\\sqrt{p}$, the square root of $p$\n",
    "- For **regression**, $m$ is typically chosen to be somewhere between $p/3$ and $p$\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of choosing a new random sample of features for every single tree at every single split is to correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set. Suppose there is one very strong feature in the data set, when using bagged trees, most of the trees will use that feature as the top split, resulting in an ensemble of similar trees that are highly correlated. By randomly leaving out candidate features from each split, Random Forests \"decorrelates\" the trees, such that the averaging process can further reduce the variance of the resulting model."

    "## Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Bagging with decision tree or using Random Forest, we can increase the predictive accuracy of individual tree. These methods, however, do decrease model interpretability, because it is no longer possible to visualize all the trees that are built to form the \"forest\". Fortunately, we can still obtain an overall summary of feature importance from these models. The way feature importance works is as follows (there are many ways to do it, this is the implementation that scikit-learn uses):\n",
    "\n",
    "We first compute the feature importance values of a single tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can initialize an array `feature_importances` of all zeros with size `n_features`\n",
    "- We start building the tree and for each internal node that splits on feature $i$ we compute the information gain (error reduction) of that node multiplied by the proportion of samples that were routed to the node and add this quantity to `feature_importances[i]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The information gain (error reduction) depends on the impurity criterion that you use (e.g. Gini, Entropy for classification, MSE for regression). Its the impurity of the set of examples that gets routed to the internal node minus the sum of the impurities of the two partitions created by the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, recall that these Ensemble Tree models simply consists of a bunch of individual trees. So we simply sum up the `feature_importance` values across all individual trees and take the average across all of them (normalize it to sum up to 1 if necessary). \n",
    "\n",
    "Building on top of the [previous documentation/implementation on decision trees](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ethen8181/machine-learning/blob/master/trees/decision_tree.ipynb), we add the code to compute the feature importance. The code is not shown here to prevent cluttering the page, but it can be obtained [here](https://github.com/ethen8181/machine-learning/blob/master/trees/tree.py) for those that are interested."

    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind when using the impurity based feature importance ranking is that when the dataset has two (or more) correlated features, then from the model's point of view, any of these correlated features can be used as the predictor, with no preference of one over the others. But once one of them is used, the importance of others is significantly reduced since the impurity they can effectively remove has already been removed by the first feature. As a consequence, they will have a lower reported importance. This is not an issue when we want to use feature selection to reduce overfitting, since it makes sense to remove features that are mostly duplicated by other features. But when we're interpreting the data, it can lead to incorrect conclusions that one of the variables is a strong predictor while the others in the same group are unimportant, while actually they are very close in terms of their relationship with the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of this phenomenon for Random Forest is somewhat reduced thanks to random selection of features at each node creation, but in general the effect is not removed completely. In the following example, we have three correlated variables $X_0$, $X_1$, $X_2$, and no noise in the data, with the output variable simply being the sum of the three features:"

One thing to point out though is that the difficulty of interpreting the importance/ranking of correlated variables is not Random Forest specific, but applies to most model based feature selection methods. This is why it often best practice to remove correlated features prior to training the model.\n",

We all know that tree-based methods employ a greedy algorithm when choosing the feature to split on. Thus, we can think of this as taking an extra step in trying to migitate this drawback\n",

    "> In practice, RFs are often more compact than ETs. ETs are generally cheaper to train from a computational point of view but can grow much bigger. ETs can sometime generalize better than RFs but it's hard to guess when it's the case without trying both first (and tuning n_estimators, max_features and min_samples_split by cross-validated grid search)."
