# Algorithms And Data Structures

## Resources

- [Github: Tech Interview Handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook) lists out curated content to help people ace their next technical interview.
- [Online book: Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html) and [Blog: BaseCS](https://medium.com/basecs) are two wonderful free online tutorial that walks through the actual content.
- [Cheatsheet: data structure cheatsheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/) is a quick reference of common data structure and algorithm's runtime that might come in handy.

## Implementation

The notebook mostly includes a short note about the topic at hand, the implementation, and links to external resources that contains more thorough material.
