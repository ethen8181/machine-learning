    "A typical statement that people make in the real world follows a pattern like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I took ibuprofen and my headache is gone, therefore the medicine worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon seeing this statement, we may be tempted to view the statement above as a causal effect, where ibuprofen does in fact help with headache. The statement, however, does not tell us what would have happened if the person didn't take the medicine. Maybe headache would have been cured without taking the medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll take a moment and introduce some notation to formalize the discussion of causal inferencing. We denote $Y^a$ as the outcome that would have been observed if treatment was set to $A = a$. In the context of causal inferencing, there are two possible actions that can be applied to an individual. $1$, treatment; $0$, control. Hence $Y^1$ denotes the outcome if the treatment was applied, whereas $Y^0$ measures the outcome if individual was under the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back to the statement above. The reason why it isn't a proper causal effect is because it's only telling us $Y^1=1$. It doesn't tell us what would have happened had we not taken ibuprofen, $Y^0=?$. And we can only state that there is a causal effect if $Y^1 \\neq Y^0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main messages that we're getting at in the section above are:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in the context of causal inferencing, a lot of times we're mainly interested in the relationship between means of different potential outcomes. \n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "\n",
    "Where the term, **potential outcome, refers to the outcome we would see under each possible treatment option**. More on this formula in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, our little statement above shows what is known as the **fundamental problem of causal inferencing**. Meaning we can only observe one potential outcome for each person. However, with certain assumptions, we can estimate population level causal effects. In other words, it is possible for us to answer questions such as: what would the rate of headache remission be if everyone took ibuprofen when they had a headache versus if no one did.\n",

    "In the previous section, we flashed the idea that with causal inferencing, we're interesting in estimating $E(Y^1 - Y^0)$. This notation denotes **average causal effect**. What this means is:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a hypothetical world where our entire population received treatment $A=0$. Versus, some other hypothetical world where everyone received the other treatment, $A=1$. The most important thing here is the two hypothetical world should have the exact same population. The only difference is the difference in our treatment. If we were able to observe both of these worlds simultaneously, we could collect the outcome data from everyone in the populations, and then compute average difference.\n",
    "\n",

It's computed over the whole population and we're saying, what would the average outcome be if everybody received one treatment, versus if everybody received another treatment. Of course, in reality, we're not going to see both of these worlds, but this is what we're hoping to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, what we get from an experiment is $E(Y|A=1)$. Here, we are saying what is the expected value of $Y$ given $A=1$. An equivalent way of reading this is the expected value of $Y$ restricting to the sub-population who actually had $A=1$. The main point that we're getting at is:\n",

Then if we take the expected value of $Y$ among people who actually got the flu shot, we're taking expected value of $Y$ among a higher risk population. And this will most likely be different than the expected value of the potential outcome $Y^1$ because $Y^1$ is the outcome if everyone in the whole population got treatment, i.e. it's not restricting to a sub-population.\n",

    "Hopefully, by now, we know the fundamental problem of causal inferencing is that we can only observe one treatment and one outcome for each person at a given point in time. The next question is how do we then use observed data to link observed outcomes to potential outcomes? To do so, we'll need make some assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our observed data typically consists of an outcome, $Y$, a treatment variable $A$, and then some set of covariates $X$ (additional information that we may wish to collect for individuals in the studies). The assumptions that we'll make are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA):** Not interference between units. Treatment assignment of one unit does not affect the outcome of another unit. Same sentence but phrased a bit differently: When we assign somebody a treatment how effective that is isn't dependent on what is happening with other people\n",
    "- **Positivity Assumption:** For every set of values for $X$, treatment assignment was not deterministic: $P(A=a|X=x) > 0$ for all $a$ and $x$. This assumption ensures we can have some data at every level of $X$ for people who are treated and not treated. The reason we need this assumption is: if for a given value of $X$, everybody would/wouldn't treated, then there's really no way for us to learn what would've happened if they were/weren't treated. In some cases where people with certain diseases might be ineligible for a particular treatment, we wouldn't want to make inference about that population, so we would probably exclude them from the study.\n",
    "- **Ignorability Assumption:** Given pre-treatment covariates $X$, treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcome. $Y^1, Y^0 \\perp A | X$ (here, $\\perp$ denotes independence). So among people with the same values of $X$, we could essentially think of treatment as being randomly assigned. This is also referred to as \"no unmeasured confounders' assumption\".\n",
    "- **Consistency Assumption:** The potential outcome under the treatment $A=a$, $Y^a$ is equivalent to the observed outcome $Y$, if the actual treatment received is $A=a$. i.e. $Y = Y^a \\text{ if } A=a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the assumptions above, we can link our observe data to potential outcomes. Given that we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "E(Y | A=a, X=x)\n",
    "&= E(Y^a | A=a, X=x) \\text{ due to consistency} \\\\ \n",
    "&= E(Y^a | X=x) \\text{ due to ignorability}\n",

    "To elaborate on the ignorability assumption, the assumption said that conditional on the set of covariates $X$, the treatment assignment mechanism doesn't matter, it's just random. So, in other words, conditioning on $A$ isn't providing us any additional information about the mean of the potential outcome here.\n",

In this case, age would be a confounder. Age is affecting both the treatment decision, which here is whether or not to receive statins, and is also directly affecting the outcome, which is cardiovascular disease. So, when it comes to confounder control, we are interested in first identifying a set of variables $X$ that will make the ignorability assumption hold.

Caveat is that these data might be messy and of lower quality.\n",

    "Keep in mind that not every plot will look like this, if there's major lack of overlap in some part of the propensity score distribution plot that means our positivity assumption would essentially be violated. Or in other words, we can't really estimate a causal effect in those area of the distribution since in those areas, those are subjects that have close to zero chance of being in the control/treatment group. One thing that we may wish to do when encountered with this scenario is either look and see if we're missing some covariates or get rid of individuals who have extreme propensity scores and focus on the areas where there are strong overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to perform matching. In general, the procedure looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We compute the distance between the estimated propensity score for each treated subject with every control. And for every treated subject we would find the subject in the control that has the closest distance to it. These pairs are \"matched\" together and will be included in the final dataset that will be used to estimate the causal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in practice there are actually many different variants to performing the step mentioned above. e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "First: We mentioned that when there's a lack of balance, we can get rid of individuals who have extreme propensity scores. Some example of doing this includes removing control subjects whose propensity score is less than the minimum in the treatment group and removing treated subjects whose propensity score is greater than the maximum in the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second: Some people would only consider the treatment and control subject to be a match if the difference between their propensity score difference is less than a specified threshold, $\\delta$ (this threshold is also referred to as caliper). In other words, given a user in the treatment group, $u_t$, we find the set of candidate matches from the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "C(u_t) = \\{ u_c \\in {\\text control} : |\\pi_{u_c} - \\pi_{u_t}| \\leq \\delta \\}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "If $|C(u_t)| = 0$, $u_t$ is not matched, and is excluded from further consideration. Otherwise, we select the control user $u_c$ satisfying:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\text{argmin}_{u_c \\in C(u_t)} \\big|\\pi_{u_c} - \\pi_{u_t}\\big|\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "and retain the pair of users. Reducing the $\\delta$ parameter improves the balance of the final dataset at the cost of reducing its size, we can experiment with different values and see if we retain the majority of the test group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third: A single user in the control group can potentially be matched to multiple users in the treatment group. To account for this, we can add a weighting to each matched record with the inverse of its frequency. i.e. if a control group user occurred 4 times in the matched dataset, we assigned that record a weight of 1/4. We may wish to check whether duplicates occurs a lot in the final matched dataset. Some implementation gives a flag whether this multiple matched control group scenario is allowed, i.e. whether matching with replacement is allowed. If replacement is not allowed, then matches generally will be found in the same order as the data are sorted. Thus, the match(es) for the first observation will be found first, the match(es) for the second observation will be found second, etc. Matching without replacement will generally increase bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll what we'll do is: for every record in the treatment we find its closest record in the control group without controlling for distance threshold and duplicates."
